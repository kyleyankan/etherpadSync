etherpadSync
============

Syncs etherpad database to a flat txt file in local folder. Great for backups, or sharing with non-etherpad users (such as todo.txt and other scripts). required an etherpadConfig.pl in the same directory containing $etherpadDomain and $etherpadAPI containing the hostname of the etherpad instand and the API key, repectively. The API Key can be found in the root folder of your etherpad install under APIKEY.txt
